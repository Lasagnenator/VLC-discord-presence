# Setup
See https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/vlc-nowplaying.244/ readme.txt for setup (ignore stuf about OBS)

Create a bot in discord:
1. Goto https://discordapp.com/developers/
2. Click “Create an Application.”
3. Setup the application how you want, give it the name VLC (), and set the image to VLC's icon (you can find one anywhere).
4. Add an image asset that is the same as the icon
5. Right under the name of your application, locate your Client ID. You will need this later.
6. Lastly, save your application.
